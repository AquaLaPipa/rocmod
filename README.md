 RoCmod 2.1c Development (Patched & Modified)


// List of Changes since standard 2.1c release

1. Fixed say crash command which allowed players to crash the server using an oversized string.
2. Added MultiKill notifications, if a player kills 2 or more people within a few seconds then it is displayed on the screen, also included sounds to accompany this (need to be added clientside in a pk3)
3. Added explosion knockback so that players are thrown back when in the radius of an explosion, ie: grenades, rockets etc..
4. Added vote announcements, players can now see what other players voted for, also added a count for remaining required votes to pass or fail a vote.
5. Added health regeneration, if a player is injured they heal back to full health and or armour.
